# Python_MOOC2025

This repository contains all the exercises I am doing for the Python MOOC course 2025.  
The MOOC is an online course provided by the University of Helsinki where you can learn Python step by step, starting from basic concepts.  
The MOOC platform also offers other courses, not only Python.  
I find it very useful and interesting even if it starts from the basics.  

You can find the MOOC here: [Python MOOC](https://www.mooc.fi/en/)

I will add all the exercises here over time as I continue learning.  
The purpose of this repository is to track my progress and practice coding in Python.
